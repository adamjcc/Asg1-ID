# One Direction Band Website

This project is an informational website themed around the band, *One Direction*, for my Interactive Development module. The idea came about after researching numerous bands, and ultimately, I decided to follow through with One Direction, as their existing website could use retouching. Through this project, I aim to create an easier, responsive and aesthetically pleasing experience for users.

Thus, the website is designed for fans and potential event organisers to explore the band’s background, view member profiles, watch videos, browse upcoming events, and submit booking enquiries - all in a clean, modern and mobile-friendly interface.
 
## Design Process
 
This website was developed using a user-centred design approach. I first identified the primary audiences and their goals, then designed the site’s structure to help them achieve these goals efficiently. Together, the combination of clear layout, strong hierarchy, simple navigation, and mobile responsiveness will ensure that the website directly supports the user's goals and provides a smooth, enjoyable experience.

### Target Users
1. **Fans / Visitors**: People who want to learn more about One Direction, view band members, watch videos, and explore media content.
2. **Event Organisers / Bookers**: Users who want quick access to tour dates and a simple, structured way to make booking enquiries.

### User Stories
- As a **fan**, I want to quickly view information about the band, so that I can learn about their history and achievements.
- As a **visitor**, I want to browse the band member profiles, so that I can get to know each member better.
- As an **event organiser**, I want to see upcoming tour dates, so that I can check availability for performances.
- As a **booker**, I want to submit an enquiry through a clear contact form, so that I can request a performance easily.

### Wireframes / Mockups
I created low-fidelity wireframes for both desktop and mobile layouts. These helped me visualise the page structure before starting development.

Here is a [link to Figma Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/design/0ABFo3mGF5f313Ly1NcB4T/ID-ASG1-Wireframe---Adam-Clark?node-id=0-1&t=qu8TDR6NNborDCFr-1).

<!-- Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. -->


## Features

<!-- In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

<!-- In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation. -->


## Testing

<!-- For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->
